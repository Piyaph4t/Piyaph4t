## 🧠 About Me
I’m a curious student who enjoys going deep into how computers actually work — from low‑level programming to large‑scale systems. I like building things that are efficient, measurable, and grounded in real engineering rather than magic abstractions.
I believe good software is not just about making things work, but understanding *why* they work, I don't like Black Box things.

# In summary, My Teacher and Senior have inspised ME to love engineering

I’m comfortable working in Linux environments and enjoy using low‑level tools, compilers, and system utilities to understand performance and behavior under the hood.
I love Linus Torvald

## 📈 Mindset
- Keep it simple and stupid (From my Teacher)
- Performance matters
- Curiosity beats memorization
- Learn the fundamentals first, optimize later (From My senior)
- Make it Happen first (From My senior)
- Engineering is about trade‑offs, not perfection
